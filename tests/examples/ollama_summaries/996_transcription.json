This kind of work schedule has become commonplace in China, especially in tech and internet companies, as technopreneurs hope this industrious attitude will translate into business success. However, the dark side of working 9-9-6 came into the spotlight in January 2021, when an employee died while working for e-commerce giant Pinduoduo. But this wasn't the first time 9-9-6 came to public attention. In 2019, an online movement called 996.icu, initiated by Chinese IT practitioners, criticized the practice of 9-9-6 in posts, stating it threatened the health of tech employees. These posts trended online as many tech workers related to the frustrations of overwork. However, many, like Nicole, still cannot escape the grind. Nicole was born in 1992. After getting her master's degree in the UK, she worked 9-9-6 in a tech company in Shenzhen for three years. In 2020, she left this company to work for one of the biggest internet companies in China. But the situation only got worse."
