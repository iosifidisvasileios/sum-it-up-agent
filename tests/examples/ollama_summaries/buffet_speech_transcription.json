      "text": "Testing, one million, two million, three million. You can always hear that anyway. When I came down today, it's been 54 years since I drove down what was then Highway 6, the Cornhusker Highway, to come to Lincoln to school. And even then there was a lot of nostalgia attached with it because my father had attended the University of Nebraska in the 1920s. He was editor of the Daily Nebraskan. And one day a young woman from West Point, a student, came in to apply for a job as a reporter on the Daily Nebraskan. And my father not only hired her as a reporter, but he married her shortly thereafter. So both my parents... attended here. My grandfather, on my mother's side, was here in the 1890s. So a lot of good things have happened to me because of the University of Nebraska. I received a terrific education here. I was telling the dean the most valuable thing I learned here, but I learned a lot, but the most valuable was accounting. And we had a wonderful professor named Ray Dean. There may even be something named for him down here, isn't there? Yeah. I mean, he was... I'd been to the Wharton School. I went to Columbia Graduate School subsequently. And I took a lot of accounting courses, but by far the best instruction I received in accounting came from Ray Dean. And there's nothing more important. People ask me what they should take in business school or even if they don't go to business school, what they need to know before getting in business. And I tell them, you know, you have to understand accounting. It's the language. I mean, it would be... It's like being in a foreign country without knowing the language if you're in business and you don't understand accounting. So it... You want to get as comfortable with that as you are with the English language. It's made me a lot of money because I listened to what Ray Dean had to say 53 or 54 years ago and have been able to understand what I was seeing on pieces of paper, what that told me about businesses and the limitations of what it told me about businesses. I mean, I... But that's the way we invest. Yesterday, I was in Knoxville, Tennessee, and we bought a company. We agreed to buy a company called Clayton Homes about a week ago. It's a big company in the manufactured home business. We agreed to pay $1.7 billion for it. I made that deal over the phone, without ever meeting the people there, but I had seen enough through reading 10-Ks, 10-Qs, annual reports, but looking at figures, what they tell me in terms of the kind of people even running the place, the kind of accounting decisions they make and so on, I was able to make that $1.7 billion transactions over the phone. Yesterday was the first time I met the people and their board of directors had actually approved the deal a week earlier. So it's... I couldn't have done that if I hadn't of... I had a great time at Ray Dean's class 53 years ago. So if I'm going to tout one thing, aside from this particular leadership class, of course, if I'm going to tout one thing, I would tell you that get comfortable with it. It may not happen the first week or the first month in the class, but get very comfortable with accounting. I run into CEOs periodically. Who really don't understand it. You know, they try to bluff their way through. And you can just see it in their faces. They're frightened almost when somebody hands them a balance sheet or an income statement. They really don't know what it means and they have to count on somebody else. And that's something you shouldn't count on. We make all our acquisition decisions ourselves. I mean, we don't call in consultants or anybody. We don't call in investment bankers much to their disgust. No investment banking fees in the Clayton-Holmes deal. Because, you know, it's my responsibility running Berkshire to understand enough about our acquisition decisions to make them based on the numbers that I see and what I see there. This course, however, is about leadership. And I'd like to talk just for a minute about that. And then I'd like to really talk about whatever's on your mind. And we'll get questions. But, you know, leadership, obviously, it's a very simple thing in concept. Uh...uh...uh... My job as the leader of Berkshire Hathaway is to have visions and goals for the company overall with a long time horizon attached to them and then to get those goals accomplished through other people. That's what it's all about. I can't do it myself. So I have to know where I want us to get to. I have to see over the next mountain if possible. But then I have to get a lot of other people. But then I have to get a lot of other people to look over that mountain with me and really do the job. I mean, they are the ones that get it accomplished. So it's getting things done through other people. Now, Berkshire is like some... like many large corporations in certain ways. But it's really quite different in many ways. Uh... We have over 150,000 people now working for Berkshire Hathaway in dozens of companies throughout this country primarily and even abroad a little bit. We have exactly 15.8 people in headquarters. And Deb Ray came down with me today. So we've only got 13.8 today. We're probably working just as well with those 13.8 as we would if Deb and I were in the office. But that's an unusual organization. I mean, we have dozens of operating managers, CEOs of their businesses, out there running them today. And they do it without any direction from the home office, except for one very limited piece of direction that I give them, which I'll get to in a second. But we have these people. And they're an unusual group of people running these businesses because most of them have sold their businesses to us. And they're very, very wealthy. Three-quarters of our managers do not need to work financially. They have no reason financially to work. Probably three-quarters of them are worth at least $50 million. And we have some that are worth in the billions. And yet these people jump out of bed every morning and work, and they work weekends, and they love working. And why is that? And what's the key to that? Well, the key really is the same reason I keep working. I'm 72. I'm getting Social Security now, so I should be in Florida, pushing shuffleboard around or something of the sort. But I can do anything in the world I want to do, but what I want to do is run Berkshire House. Now, why do I want to run it that way? There's a couple things. A, I get to paint my own painting. I go down there every day, and I feel like Michelangelo there working on the Sistine Chapel or something. Nobody else may think it's a great painting, but I get to paint my own painting. I do not have people second-guessing me. I do not have people saying, why don't you use a little more red paint than blue paint? Why don't you paint a seascape instead of a landscape? I get to do my own thing. It's a form of creativity. It's exactly like somebody feels it's a professional golfer or somebody feels it's a painter. They're not doing it for the money, primarily. They're doing it because they like doing something well and that it happens to be down the route of their talents. And the second thing I like, frankly, is I like applause. I like appreciation. So I like having shareholders who feel good about what I've done. I have a 96-year-old aunt, and her husband went to the University of Nebraska, too. And she has all her money in Berkshire Hathaway, and she counts on me. And she's out in Palm Springs now, and her whole net worth is in Berkshire. And I've got cousins, and everybody in our family has got all their money in Berkshire. And so those people are counting on me, and that's kind of fun to have something where you can actually deliver for other people. And change their lives in positive ways. As a matter of fact, we had a couple that nobody had ever heard of up until a few years ago. The Othmers in New York. They came from Omaha. Don Othmer went to Central High. Mitt Othmer, I'm not sure which high school she went to in Omaha, probably South High. They left $750 million when they died. Nobody had ever heard of them. And I think a substantial portion went right here to the University of Nebraska. It was probably a total surprise to the University when they got, I don't know, you probably got $150 million or so. Well, you should thank the Othmers, but nevertheless, you see the money, you see good things happening out of it. So it's fun. It beats playing golf every day or something of the sort. So I say if that's what turns me on, what's going to turn on these managers that are out there running things like Clayton Homes, or we've got a company, Flight Safety trains more pilots than anybody in the world. Flight Safety is run by an 85-year-old man, Al Yulshi. Al started the company with $10,000 in 1951. It now trains four or five times as many pilots, non-military pilots, as anybody in the world. And he is there at 85, and it's a matter of public record, he's got a billion dollars worth of Berkshire shares. He works seven days a week. And he loves it for the same reason that I love what I do. He gets to do it his way. He buys these big simulators that you train pilots in. He doesn't have to check with me as to whether to spend $15 million for a simulator. He doesn't ask me. He knows so much more about it than I do. Why in the world would he ask me? Well, I can't tell what kind of a plane I'm in when I'm flying around. And Al is spending a couple hundred million dollars a year on simulators, spending Berkshire Hathaway money, and he's never had to come to Omaha. For any kind of meetings, he runs his own business. And that's what he loves in life. And I let him do it. That's my contribution to it, is really turning loose his energies. They were properly directed before we bought the company seven or eight years ago. Why should I think that he couldn't keep running it after that? And like I said, at 85, he's still running it. The second thing that our managers like, in addition to painting their own painting, is they too love applause. I mean, I try to be, I report in my annual report accurately what they've accomplished. But they accomplished a lot. You heard Susan Jock, I think, some weeks ago here. Susan came to Borsheim's and she was making $4 an hour. $4 an hour. And at age, before she was 40, she became CEO of the second largest independent jewelry operation in the United States. From $4 an hour. But it's talent. And Susan knows more about, I don't know anything about jewelry. You could hand me a phony diamond or a real diamond, I couldn't tell the difference. But if I started telling Susan what to order in the way of jewelry, or if I started telling her what kind of terms to extend to customers, or who to hire, or anything like that, she doesn't need that in life. She really owns Borsheim's. We have the stock certificate, which we get accustomed to. But, it's her baby. She decides everything about that place. So it's her creation. And that feeling of ownership is really extraordinary. And it's so much better. It's the way I like to work. It's the way Susan Jock likes to work. It's the way Al Yoshi likes to work. And Susan, like anybody else in this world, loves being appreciated. Whether she did it or not, the truth is nobody appreciates her more than I do. I mean, she is a talent. And we are lucky to have her. And we're lucky to have all of these other managers. So, leadership at Berkshire really consists of taking a bunch of people who in a baseball analogy would be 400 hitters and just handing them the bat. And just telling them to get off their plate and take a big swing. One thing I do is I send them a letter. We don't have meetings in Omaha. Some of our managers there aren't any meetings. And there's no catechism or anything else. Once every two years I send them a letter. This is it. Roughly one and a half pages or so. The only instruction they get from us. They don't send budgets to us. We don't care about those. Some of the companies use budgets. Some don't use budgets. We adjust to them. I talk to a couple times a week because they like to talk frequently. Some of them I talk to literally once a year because they don't like to talk to me. It's up to them. I adapt to them. The only thing I tell them and this letter which went out January 20, 2003 it says it's been two and a half years since my last memo. How many big companies have the managers out there been two and a half years since they heard from the home office. It's been two and a half years since my last memo. Number one. This is number one every time. This doesn't change. It won't change two years from now or four years from now or six years from now. Number one. We can afford to lose money. Even a lot of money. We cannot afford to lose reputation. Even a shred of reputation. Let's be sure that everything we do in business can be reported on the front page of a national newspaper in an article written by an unfriendly but intelligent reporter. We don't want Berkshire's results to benefit from its reputation and we don't want to do anything that in any way can tarnish it. Last year Berkshire was ranked by Fortune as the fourth most admired company in the world. This year we were third in the United States. They just published it. It took us 37 years to get there but we could lose it in 37 minutes. And that's the message. We can lose money. It's nicer to make money but we'll figure out ways to make money. But we can't lose a shred of reputation. Because you don't get it back. And you can. I said 37 minutes but you can lose it a lot faster than that. You can lose it in 5 minutes. In fact I was talking to Bruce coming in and he did some work around Solomon Brothers and I went back there 11 years ago because this firm which had the second largest balance sheet in the United States at that time it was a preeminent firm on Wall Street. John Goodfriend who ran it had his picture on the front of Businessweek as the king of Wall Street. And in April late in April 1991 he made a fateful decision. It was reported to him that an employee down the line had flim flammed the U.S. Treasury had broken some rules tried to play games with him. And John did not report that fact to the Treasury or the Federal Reserve or the SEC or to anybody else. He didn't do anything wrong himself but he just he got behind the curve. He didn't report it. The president of the company, Tommy Strauss didn't report it. If you saw that Katie Couric show on Sunday night on the Central Park jogger Tom Strauss was on there but Tom Strauss ended up losing his he was president of Solomon Brothers John was chairman, John Goodfriend they didn't do anything. They dawdled. And after a few weeks the same guy that had done committed the terrible acts earlier on May 15th he did the same thing again at a Treasury auction. And now they were in this terrible pickle because they had known about this on about April 28th that this guy was a bad actor and they hadn't done anything. And now on May 15th he does the same thing again. And now if they go and have it out of their mind and do other things and it came within inches of destroying the firm. It destroyed their careers. I mean John Goodfriend who spent 30 years in Wall Street and had a fine reputation the king of Wall Street was brought down by one simple act of omission. All he had to do was pick up the phone Jerry Corrigan was head of the New York Fed he had to pick up the phone and say this crazy guy in our Treasury Department Felony Mosier has just done this thing and I'm terribly embarrassed and what can we do to make it right? And Jerry Corrigan being Jerry Corrigan would have turned red in the face and gotten very mad and issued a lot of language I couldn't repeat here but in the end he would have said thanks for calling and telling us about it immediately and we'll slap a fine on you or do whatever is appropriate and the next day the firm would have gone on fine but John Goodfriend actually a perfectly okay guy but he just he didn't act when it counted and Tommy Strauss who was number two the same way and later on they were fined and in a certain way kicked out of the securities industry and Solomon barely survived. 8,000 employees around the world had their future in real jeopardy because of that single act so just the newspaper test I tell our managers I can have a thousand page book of ethics I can have all kinds of rules but in the end all you have to do is think about do you really want what you're doing put on the front page of the paper tomorrow to be read by your parents by your spouse, by your kids by your neighbors, by your coworkers and if you're embarrassed about it just forget about it you're all going to do well financially the nice thing about it is you live in America in the year 2003 you don't live in Bangladesh you don't live in America in 1791 you live in a society which has a GDP of over 10 trillion and you can just pick up the crumbs and you're going to do great you've all got the qualities it takes three qualities essentially to do well and extremely well actually in this country it takes intelligence it takes energy and it takes integrity now everybody in this room has the requisite intelligence you wouldn't be here if you didn't I mean it doesn't take 180 IQs although I'm sure you all have those but it takes reasonable intelligence you're getting a great education you've got the energy that's why you've shown up in school and it takes integrity and I say if you don't have integrity we don't want to hire somebody that's got intelligence and energy if they don't have integrity because they'll probably never get around to cheating as they're doing something last thing in the world I want is somebody that lacks Mosher had intelligence and energy at Solomon he was head of the government bond trading and he had lots of intelligence and he had lots of energy and he went to jail and he almost brought down the firm and integrity is absolutely an option you may not be able to throw a football 60 yards you may not be able to run the hundred in nine years you may not be able to sink three pointers but you can choose where you stand on the integrity scale you weren't born wired one way or the other that is an absolute choice you make and the heroes I've had in life other than the people that I felt stood out in that respect my number one hero was my dad but I've had other heroes Tom Murphy, Ben Graham, people like that and the reason I admired them is because they were the smartest people in the world although they were plenty smart and it wasn't because they made the most money that meant nothing it's really because I felt they were the classiest people that I ever met in my life I saw them behave over year after year after year in a way that I could write their story on the front page of any newspaper and even in an unfriendly tone I could not do anything that would embarrass them in the least they behaved extraordinarily well and I think that's why it's so important to have the right heroes it's terribly important you tell me who a ten year old's heroes are and I can give you a pretty good prediction about how they're going to turn out you want to choose your heroes very carefully because you're going to look like them at some point and you're lucky if you've got the right ones I'll give you an aside and then we'll get on to your questions but it's something you're not parent shit most of you are the natural hero of your child I mean there's a great big thing there's two of you great big things and there's a little tiny child you are the natural hero and anything they get to school subsequently or anything else they're going to be shaped more by what they see in this behavior of yours toward them than anything that will impact them later in their lives and if they want you to be the hero you can destroy that of course you've seen it done many many times but actually if the parents are proper heroes the child is about 90% of the way home and you're lucky if you've had parents like that and you can be that to your children or you can be something else you're shaping that person it's nice to learn accounting when you get to Nebraska but the behavior model that you take on let's talk about what's on your mind you can ask tough questions it's more fun for me and they can be about business they can be personal they can be political you pick it out"

      "text": "where you make your donations oh well we've got a there's a Buffet Foundation eventually it will have everything basically everything I've made will go back to society America's done it for me that's where it should go I've got about an eight page letter that the trustees have already seen there's very few trustees I don't believe in large groups of people making decisions it gets to be it sort of descends to the lowest common denominator so there's only what maybe five or six trustees interestingly enough not just by accident but I picked the people who I trust in the most in terms of both their intelligence but also their quality to run it people I feel the surest of a significant majority will be women it will be a woman controlled foundation and probably the largest foundation in the world at the time but with a very small number of trustees I have in my letter I tell them that I'm not going to give them any specific instructions as to what to do with the money I tell them that their judgement above ground will be better than my judgement six feet underground so in the end I want them but I want them to do a couple of things I want them to attack really big important causes I don't want them to give a million dollars here and a million dollars there and everybody that asks that they know and that sort of thing so I don't want them doing things with an eyedropper I want them to swing take very big swings and then I want them to measure what they're doing by the importance of what they're doing as contrasted to the natural funding constituency for that now taking the health field I mean you have the National Institute of Health spending billions and billions of dollars you have all kinds of money going into medical research it would be crazy in my view for the Buffet Foundation to be engaged in medical research it's not that the subjects isn't important it's really a huge funding constituency it would be crazy for the money to go to Harvard or something of the sort it isn't a fine educational institution but you've got all of these people that give money to Harvard and they've got a rich alumni base and all of that sort of thing so I want the combination of a terribly important program and the lack of a natural funding constituency well where do you find that you find that with unpopular causes to quite a degree Rockefeller felt somewhat the same way it's interesting he was the first major patron of any sort of black colleges in the United States now if you think about it black colleges had no funding constituency I mean their alumni didn't have any money basically if you go back 75 or 100 years so there wasn't any money coming people didn't you know they didn't build great businesses and then leave tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to the institution and it was self perpetuating and so Rockefeller stepped in and he took a group of black colleges and funded them in a very very big way and I admire that kind of a decision enormously otherwise nothing would have happened and that's what I hope the trustees of the Buffett Foundation do I was with Bill Gates last week and I consider his foundation he and Melinda together because they're equal partners in it I consider their foundation to be the most logical big foundation in the world they're giving away about a billion dollars a year now Bill said and Melinda said to the themselves how do we save the most lives per dollar spent in the world and they decided that in certain major medical areas that what was being done abroad in many countries was zilch in terms of these things that were easily preventable by vaccines or various other things and they decided they could save huge numbers of lives per billion dollars spent but they'd be spending it you know in places like India and Africa where they would get no credit in the United States I mean no buildings with their name no nothing but that was their metric and that's Bill's sole metric I mean he doesn't want to talk about you can go to him with some proposition to stick his name on something you know for 50 million dollars it doesn't interest him at all he is it's a totally rational and he pours himself into it he has educated himself on medicine and particularly medicine outside the United States in a way that I've never seen anybody and I've got good news for you this you should write down on May 2 on public broadcast there will be a program where Bill with Bill Moyers Bill Moyers is interviewing him and Bill explains his philanthropic thinking and it I went there it was taped at Columbia University and in fact you may even see me in the audience sitting next to him a little bit the that is going to be a great program they took about an hour and 20 minutes and it's going to get edited down to 56 or 58 minutes but you will hear as you will hear as an argument for rational philanthropy on that program as you will ever hear in your life so I it's interesting that program came about because about two years ago I asked Bill a question at a group I get together something akin to what you asked him I asked him to talk about the evolution of his philanthropic thinking and there were a group of about 60 of us there and he talked to us and I mean it was a fabulous talk and I just I said you know you got to get that out in the public domain somehow so this thing with bone wires does that if I die tonight all my Berkshire shares which are 99% of my net worth plus go to my wife she dies first hers go to me and then it all goes to the Buffet Foundation and it will then be active on a very big big scale and those are the guidelines and who knows what those problems will be I mean it probably it might well have been civil rights in the early 60s I mean the civil rights organizations you know were not being funded by anybody and I mean money wasn't the big problem but it was a problem in the civil rights arena and there was no natural funding constituency for that it was an important very important issue but it was an unpopular issue in many respects and it seems to me that's where the money should go particularly if you have it on a big scale where you can really do something depends when I die but you know 10 or 15 years from now the foundation could really I mean it could have a lot of money and so they could do some things that nobody else could attempt and it won't be what people want them to do you know that's the nature of it if it was what people wanted to do it would already be being done interesting thing the contrast between business and philanthropy is interesting in business I swing at easy pitches I stand there at the plate and if I like pitches one inch above my navel right in the center of the plate I can wait and wait and wait because there's no called strikes you know as long as that bats on my shoulder nobody's calling a strike if the pitcher throws me General Motors at 36 IBM at 82 Microsoft at 25 and I don't swing it's not a strike it's not a hit either but it's not a strike only when I swing is it a strike so I wait for easy pitches I wait for things I understand are exactly in my sweet spot philanthropy is just the opposite you're looking at the toughest problems the world faces and they're intractable to some extent I mean these are tough tough problems and they have resisted the utilization of money over the years and that's what makes them tough problems I mean the problems you can solve with money are the easy ones the problems you can't solve with money so they are very tough problems one thing I've gotten involved in just a little bit recently is something that Sam Nunn is heading the former senator called the nuclear threat initiative and essentially Sam Nunn who is who is as well informed as anybody in the world on the subject and articulate and everything is working on the problem of the nuclear materials and or nuclear talent that exists around the world that might become available to terrorists or to governments to impose on the rest of the society and there are vast amounts of uranium and lesser amounts of plutonium and there's a lot of unemployed Russian scientists and so on so this is something that Ted Turner actually set up a couple of years ago and got Sam to handle and because AOL Time Warner stock which was being used to fund it from Ted has gone down a lot in price they've run short of money so that's something I'm involved in it doesn't you know it's not something that has any popular appeal you can't raise you can't send out something and get hundreds of thousands of people to respond but but that's the kind of thing that I think you know the foundation should be doing"

and they care about being treated fairly on compensation but they don't measure it against everybody else they don't have a lawyer they're negotiating with me I don't have a compensation arrangement with any of these managers that can't be put in one paragraph and then I go to other companies where they have a lawyer come in and there's 80 pages it tells what's happened how much they get paid in

out there that causes the Claytons of the world the Al Yoshis of the world the Ike Friedmans of the world the Mrs. B's of the world to come to us when I made the deal with Mrs. B in 1983 Mrs. B had another offer from somebody else that was somewhat higher and she just said I don't care she only owned 20% of the company she had 4 children they each owned 20% she told them I'm selling to Mr. Buffet she always called me Mr. Buffet up until when she was 104 in fact when I'd walk in the store she'd say here comes my new young boyfriend I don't get that a lot of places I can tell you but she she built this thing she came over here in 1921 or 2 she landed in Seattle with a tag around her neck she couldn't speak a word of English said Fort Dodge, Iowa she couldn't communicate she just had the tag the American Red Cross got her out to Fort Dodge and for 2 years she got no place because nobody spoke Russian or Yiddish actually and so she moved to Omaha just to be around some other Russian Jews she could at least talk to she learned the English language when her oldest daughter Frances would go to school and come home at night and teach her the words and she started sending 50 bucks at a time over to Russia to bring her sister she had 7 siblings and her mother and father to get them over here after 16 years she brought all the family over she saved $500 in 16 years peddling used clothing whatever and she started in the rest of the furniture market at $500 and it's now the largest home furnishings complex in the world and it all came from $500 and a very special woman and can you imagine building something like that and selling it to some financial operator who's going to resell it and go public with it a couple of years later and it meant something to her she wanted it to continue like it has continued and those are the kind of people we want to attract it isn't so much me selecting them it's them selecting Berkshire that's the key and frankly we've gotten to that position in this country where the people that do care about their businesses there's no second choice besides Berkshire we get them if we had a woman Doris Christopher come to us last year Doris Christopher in 1980 had two little girls lived in Chicago lived in a probably $20,000 house and she and her husband both worked she was looking for something to do to make a little extra money she thought about catering and decided that would take her away from the kids too much so she decided that what she knew best though was she'd been a home ec teacher she knew cooking and she knew the kitchen and what was useful to people so she borrowed $3,000 in our life insurance policy that's all she had she went down to the merchandise mart in Chicago and said what's the least amount of this utensil or that utensil a manufacturer would sell usually a dozen and she took them home and then she had the idea that she would hold these parties essentially in people's homes and so she arranged with a woman in suburban Chicago to hold the first party she almost turned back she started driving there she thought it would laugh at me and I'd knock the stuff over and they won't buy what you do she was very unsure of herself but she went there she sold I think $175 worth of goods she sold me her business last year and that business made $140 million pre-tax from this $3,000 investment that woman had a passion for her business she loved her customers she loved the people that worked with her she got 67,000 associates it's called the pampered chef some of you may have been to a pampered chef party almost one woman out of ten in the United States bought something from us last year and now unfortunately I have to acknowledge she probably didn't understand accounting that well but she understood her customer and she understood people and she likes people I met her one time when she wanted to sell her business as far as she was concerned she came to Omaha we made a deal in a few minutes the compensation deal took us 15 seconds she's running the business I've never been there I hope they're there we paid a lot of money for this someday we'll buy a business and there'll just be some guy in a closet saying what figures shall I send Warren this month but I've never been there I've met her and I've seen the results of what she's done and she is in love with the company"

it dominates it because it calls on these 18,000 people it has a sales force calling on them 6 or 8 times a year and it has 22 plants around the country that can get the frame that the custom framer orders 85% of the time if they order it by 5 o'clock today they'll have it by 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon now think of that coverage that's what the customer wants they don't care whether they pay $83 or $88 to get the thing framed you've got something you want done and you want it done fast and that little custom framer they want happy customers and that means speed of delivery and certainty and all that you couldn't build a distribution system to compete with us just think of trying to build a distribution system starting from scratch that would take that business away from us it can't be done well Craig explained that to me in about 15 minutes I'd never thought about the custom frame business but I've framed pictures or had people frame before me and I understood the power of that that was a Monday I said I think we can make a deal so he came on Wednesday he came at 9 o'clock and he left at 10 o'clock we've had a deal and I've never seen him since he got the money promptly thereafter he wasn't going to come to the annual meeting last year but his wife was sick he'll probably come this year he's a good guy and no one can knock us off in that business every time I buy a business I say to myself if I had a billion dollars and I wanted to go in and compete with these guys could I knock them off if you gave me a billion dollars and you told me to dislodge Snickers as the number one candy bar in the country if you tell me I've got a billion dollars and I've got to make it or five billion and I've got to make it so that Wrigley's, Spearmint, Double Mint, Juicy Fruit all of those get knocked off the top selling gun list I can't do it now if you give me if you give me a billion dollars and tell me to knock off all the ladies apparel shops in Lincoln I'll make mincemeat of them very fast I may not have a very good business myself but I can destroy that and the real test is something how many destroy the business you've got if he decides to compete with you and we try to buy businesses where no matter who comes along they've got this durable competitive advantage those are the three words that count you may be able to make that decision about companies that I can't make that decision about they have to be pretty simple for me but we buy things that we have Fruit of the Loam underwear are people going to quit wearing underwear well who knows but we sell 34% of all the men's and boys underwear that goes through Walmart and all of the mass merchandising chains we've got the lowest costs around Fruit of the Loam is a name that's been around since 1850 or 60 you know if you can buy three pairs of shorts from us or six pairs or whatever for five and a half bucks and nobody's going to sell them cheaper why are you going to buy anything else so we'll own that unless we mess it up some way we've got a very potent advertising slogan there we cover the asses of the masses sort of gets to it yeah up there yeah"
