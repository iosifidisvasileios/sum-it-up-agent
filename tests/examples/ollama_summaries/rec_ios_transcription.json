So, yeah, look, I'm sorry I don't have better news for you, but I wanted to share some feedback and also interested to hear your thoughts. By the way, the feedback is by no means bad feedback. I think it's a case of, you know, where Vladimir felt you were kind of indexing against a couple of key requirements. So, you know, I don't think there's anything for you to be concerned about in terms of anything you did badly or maybe, you know, I think in some cases, potentially, your answers may have given a slightly different impression. But, I don't know. I don't know. I'll come on to that in a moment. I guess first things first. What were your thoughts?"

Everything was by the book. I have nothing to complain."

      "text": "Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say that. I think there is some additional context to add here. As I explained to you previously, the staff data scientist role in the team is, firstly, it's the first staff data scientist in this team. And, secondly, it is also at the staff level. There's a high expectation. You know, we have a certain bar that we want people to hit, and, you know, it's actually pretty difficult to do that. So, you know, the pass rate for these interviews is not spectacularly high. And I don't necessarily think that's a sign of candidates doing a bad job. I think it's more that our expectations are high. And, actually, there's no negative feedback as such. Really, the main question mark is, is Vasilis measurably more experienced? Or, is she bringing something to the team that we don't already have today? And, you know, when we're looking to bring somebody in at staff level, and we're not promoting somebody into that role, of course, we need to consider that there needs to be almost that level of separation, if that makes sense."

      "speaker": "SPEAKER_01",
      "text": "Yes. And I think that, if I was to distill the feedback into its simplest form, it's that Vladimir didn't feel like he was doing a good job. He didn't feel that you demonstrated that you were sufficiently more experienced than our existing senior data scientists. And, therefore, he didn't think that, for this role anyway, he saw enough to justify taking you through to the next stage as a staff-level candidate. So, from a kind of pros and cons point of view, in terms of the pros, you know, I think you did a good job. In terms of explaining your experience, and one thing that I liked when I met with you, and something that Vladimir also mentioned, is that you definitely showed a good drive to what I would call a bit more of a hacker mentality. So, you're actually looking at proactively solving problems, not necessarily waiting to be asked. You're thinking of, how can I do this better? And I think you did a good job of exemplifying that, and, you know, building proof of concepts. And, you know, you gave me one big example of that, which I guess you probably see as your biggest achievement in your role at the moment. I think that was really good, and also he said that, you know, at the staff level we look for people that are capable of mentoring others, and he did see some evidence of that. And he said that, obviously, your experience in academia when you're a mentoring student shows that you've got the, I guess, the capability to do that. But maybe where that was less evidential was actually doing that, you know, That could've meant that some of your experience in academia and you're a mentoring student showed you got the, I guess the capability to do that, but maybe where that was less evidential was actually doing that, in your role right now with peers at a more senior level than students that makes sense and then he also said that your experience from a technical perspective in terms of working with large language models your classic ml experience all came across well from a comms point of view we look for our staff level data scientists to provide informal technical leadership it's probably the best way of putting it and i think he didn't really see enough evidence of that um and i don't know specifically how this maybe came across but he said that um you have sort of admitted that you prefer your managers to drive things and get a little bit of direction around that i don't know i don't know if i'm sort of putting his words in the right way but essentially uh along those lines um and then lastly from more of a kind of technical point of view we have an experimentation framework which is a little bit different and what you're experiencing is primarily offline as opposed to online at the moment and so there's definitely a little bit of a disconnect there but i think these are small things that i don't necessarily think are a performance piece um i think it's maybe a case of not quite demonstrating enough evidence of those things called staff level role and perhaps you know also tempered by us having high expectations on all of those areas so you know i don't think there's anything the challenge with this is normally i want to try and give you something constructive um and i don't think there is much that you necessarily could have done differently like obviously you work in the environment you work in if you have predominantly work and you don't have the same experimentation platform that's not your fault it's just you know something that uh it is what it is um and then with regards to some of the other aspects around sort of informal technical leadership maybe you could have given some better examples around that but i don't think it would have been you know i don't think you did anything badly let's put it that way yeah yeah got it yeah i mean i hope some of that feedback kind of resonates with you i think they were definitely for me more positives than negatives it really just comes down to that question mark over you know there's definitely an extra level of sensitivity i would say in this case because we're not promoting somebody internally you know we need to have that degree of separation and i think that's where vladimir is essentially drawing the line here um that's not i don't know that would be necessarily consistent across the the org so we don't have we only have one other staff level position at the moment which i'm also working on but it's within our ad tech team i'm really looking for somebody with specific experience around ranking recommendation systems and similar which i guess you you don't really have um but would i be hesitant about putting you forward for another staff opportunity personally no i think it's a big team and maybe there's less sensitivity around that are they or aren't they at that level would be uh would be my question but look vladimir thought you you interviewed well thought you were a good candidate he thought you came across well and articulated your experience well it was just purely that question mark over whether uh you know you're true truly"
