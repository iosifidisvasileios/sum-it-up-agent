We have some amount of, like, we have a stage of, you know, a metaphorical stage to say something to the world and we'll get some amount of press attention because we're having an event, right? What kind of announcements do we make? Um, at GitLab, it's really, really tough to make product announcements because our entire road map is completely public. Yada, yada, yada. So the thought here is to, but also because our entire road map is completely public and because we shift these tiny little MVCs, a new feature will come out, but it'll be not really usable, right? So it takes a while. So if you look back over the past year and say, okay, like, what started in the last year, but now is really like a full-fledged feature, what would, what would be coming out of beta, right? Like, if we were any other company, when we started a beta program in this last year, what would be, be announcing is GA at commit? That's kind of, that's kind of my thought on it.

And if someone hasn't done it, maybe that'll also kick in. I was going, send this direction here, which was thinking, you know, a lot of, and then I called them key iterations, the sort of specific things. So I listed a few specific things like three or four per each as key iterations, but I called them something overall. So we would have like one thing to call them. There's several key iterations aligned with Giddyly Cluster, several that rolled up to a research-based user experience. And I was thinking like, I was shy on calling out UX as a bucket, except that, actually, that's, that's super typical, right? Like Windows 11 or anybody who's rolling stuff out, they almost always have UX as one of their three things. And then they mentioned a longer list of stuff that aligns to that. So I, you know, forgave myself for doing something at first. That was kind of like shy about calling out UX and bucketing some things there, but actually, when I looked around, that's pretty much how everybody does a big launch. And in terms of the excitement level, that also, like, I went in thinking, this is just a two. I guess part of it is like, I feel like we're almost fixing something that's broken. And that's not something you want to shout from the rooftops about. But actually, some of that stuff's really cool. So I gave it a three excitement level. I wasn't sure exactly where to place things. But I figured I wouldn't like the Cindy's comment, have something that's a one here anyway. But I, the only way I could make sense of like, the iterations was to bucket them as something. And so that's kind of how I came down on it."
